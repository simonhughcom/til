# Today I Learned
A collection of small things I have learned day to day. Each TIL is a small and concise post of a interesting ability of an application, language or technology and maybe a few other things sprinkled in.

## Honourable Mentions
I "borrowed" this idea from [jbranchaud/til](jbranchaud/til).
I looked through his TIL's and there is some really good stuff there.
